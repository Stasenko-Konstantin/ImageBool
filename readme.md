ImageBool (This is not the final version yet. You may receive errors.)

Two interconnected programs (python and rust): one draws, the other works with the results of the first. You can draw something in the pixel art style and then do some manipulation with the fruits of your labor.

After starting IB, you need to configure the console to display the program correctly. Description for windows. Right click on the console title and a dropdown will appear. Select Properties. On the "Font" tab, select "Consolas" and size 12. On the "Location" tab, set the window width, size = 188, and length = 49. At least I have similar settings, but you can play with these parameters for more comfortable experience.

Two text files (i1.txt and i2.txt) should be in the ImageBool folder. If you run the source code with cargo ("\IB\"), then you have nothing to worry about, if the executable file (not from "\IB\"), then you yourself have to transfer the text files to the directory with the executable file.

You can draw your text files to "\pic\" by running either a script or an executable file. The right mouse button is to paint over the square, the left one is like an eraser. In the top menu "Файл -> Сохранить" - ​​saves your drawing. Be warned in advance: launching, opening files and closing program can be slow.
